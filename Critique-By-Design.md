# Critique By Design
## I chose to critique a figure from the Hollywood Diversity Report 2019.

The original data visualization can be found [here](/https://socialsciences.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/UCLA-Hollywood-Diversity-Report-2019-2-21-2019.pdf#page=53).  This report and the data visualization was authored by Dr. Darnell Hunt, Dr. Ana-Christina Ramon, and Michael Tran.

I selected this data visualization because I originally came across it when I was reading the article, and it stopped me in my tracks. I sat staring at it for a while, trying to figure out exactly what it was saying. I consider myself fairly data-visualization-literate, and I struggled to interpret it. A few simple adjustments occurred to me immediately, so I chose to redesign it. Once I began the process however, I realized there were a lot of complications and confusing aspects to the data points themselves, making the redesign more difficult than I originally anticipated. I did not only pick this because it personally confused me, though. Diverse representations on screen are something that I champion for their own sake, and if there is data proving that film studios and prodcers have a financial incentive as well, all the better.  I found this specific visualization, though it had a noble goal, unmotivating for its intended audience of Hollywood financiers and film executives.  If the visualization were better, perhaps we could really understand the relationship between minority cast share and Global Box Office revenues in a way that would increase the diversity in casting.

When I created my first wireframe, I started to uncover some oddities in the data and how it was categorized that I found difficult to avoid. The questions I asked about my wireframe (pictured below) and the responses were as follows:

*Can you tell me what you think this is?*
*"...comparing different years...different receipts globally for different movies.*

Not off to a great start here. This person thought that each stacked bar, meant to represent a year, was a different movie. I then asked the question:

*Can you describe to me what this is telling you?"

"Oh, each of them is years. OK, so this is telling me that the higher the percentage of minorities, the more money it makes"*

This is generally the idea the original visualization was attempting to get across, but it is actually not entirely truthful, nor is it what my visualization actually shows. In fact, there was not a single year in the data set where the highest minority cast share group also had the highest Global Box Office.

*Anything you find surprising or confusing?* (I had a lot to work with here. My first wireframe remained very confusing.)

*"2013 didn't have as many minorities...oh wait that's 2015...." 

"It's surprising that 2016 & 2017 had more minorities therefore giving the highest revenue when 2015 was so low"

"Is this including every single movie made in 2016?"* This tells me I need to define my data set and its scope more clearly.
*"What are the numbers [in the boxes] for? Is that the number of movies?"* I originally thought putting the revenue values in the stacked bar chart would help clarify the relative change, but it definitely confused my observers. This also indicated to me that they were not understanding what the "median" meant in the title and axes. If they had, and they had deduced that the y-axis was showing median GBO revenue, they would likely not have been confused by this.
*"I'm not sure what the percent is of"* This was referring to the category key at the bottom of the wire frame. Even though the title says "Minority Cast Share" I realized that is not a universally recognized phrase through this comment. The next iteration needs to account for this somehow, either by adjusting the categories or including a definition of "minority cast share."
*Who is the intended audience?
"One could be investors to films...or I guess producers possibly...and the other could be film studios."* I seem to have at least communicated the intended audience well!

*Is there anything you would like to change?
"it's hard to tell the difference between the colors."
