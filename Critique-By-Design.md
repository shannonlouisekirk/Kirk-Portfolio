# Critique By Design
## I chose to critique a figure from the Hollywood Diversity Report 2019.

The original data visualization can be found here[/https://socialsciences.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/UCLA-Hollywood-Diversity-Report-2019-2-21-2019.pdf#page=53].  This report and the data visualization was written by Dr. Darnell Hunt, Dr. Ana-Christina Ramon, and Michael Tran.

I selected this data visualization because I originally came across it when I was reading the article, and it stopped me in my tracks. I sat staring at it for a while, trying to figure out exactly what it was saying. I consider myself fairly data-visualization-literate, and I struggled to interpret it.
