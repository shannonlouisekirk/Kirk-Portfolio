## Part I: The Project Proposal and Outline

My original project outline had a different topic and scope, but it informed the direction I ultimately decided to go with my project. To view my original project outline, see [here.](/Final-Project-Outline.md)

### What Am I Trying to Do?

The film industry measures success in two distinct ways: through prestigious award-winning and through the amount of money made at the box office. By pulling publicly available box office data and merging it with data about Oscar winners, I hoped to examine whether these two ways of measuring success were ever found together, or if they were distinct.

While this in itself interests me, I wanted to include something about a social or representational aspect of the industry as well, especially as that was the full focus of my original proposal. I ultimately landed with the female director perspective for a few reasons:

1. The idea of attaining success in more than one avenue - "having it all" - very clearly harkens to feminist cultural language, so weaving the thematic thread for this persepctive felt natural.
2. There are so few female directors that it allowed me to create a comprehensive data set, as gender-associated data was not easily available. It would have been an extraordinary amount of effort to do the same for producers (there are often around five producers for large films) or for cast or line share.
3. I myself am a female director, so this perspective gave me the ability to form a call to action that was meaningful to me.

### Initial Sketches (Relevant to Where the Project Ended Up)

For a more sketches of where I was originally headed, again, feel free to view [my original project outline.](/Final-Project-Outline.md)

Sketches I drew initially that are relevant to my final project outcome are below.

### The Data

The data files that I compiled and used for the final project can be found here 
for box office data: https://shannonlouisekirk.github.io/Kirk-Portfolio/Box Office Data.xlsx
for Oscars data: https://shannonlouisekirk.github.io/Kirk-Portfolio/Oscars Data.xlsx

If you are unable to access the data through GitHub, you can view them here: https://cmu.box.com/s/8tnr89kwm1h9s4aby63727kxe7y4q794

I compiled all of the box office data using https://www.boxofficemojo.com/, and I compiled all Oscars data using https://www.imdb.com/. Both of these data source did require that I do a good amount of manual work to join the data, ensure that the movies were being reported the same way (for example, Beauty & the Beast vs Beauty and the Beast). The Oscars data in particular was very manual. To match directors with their films, I essentially just had to search IMDb and manually type in the values. Similarly, to create the binary identifications for male/female director and to create the binary distinctions for nominated for Best Picture/Best Director, I had to manually evaluate each observation and assign the appropriate value.

### Method and Medium

#### Method

My method generally followed asking the following questions:

1. *Can I point to examples of box office success vs critical success in a clear way so the audience understands the general idea?"*
2. *Are there any outstanding points in the data that are worth noting?*
3. *Is there a compelling story behind any of these individual observations?*
4. *Female representation behind the camera in Hollywood is widely recognized to be poor. Are there new ways to think about this that sheds light on the state of representation and where there is most obviously room for improvement?*
5. *Is either box office success or critical success more favorable to female directors, or are they equally poorly represented in each?*

#### Medium

As noted in the above link to the final project, I used Shorthand as the medium.

## Part II: Wireframes, Storyboards, Moodboards, and User Research

By the time I had arrived at Part II, I had shifted to closer to what the final project ended up representing. For the original submission of Part II, see [here.](/Final-Project-Part-II.md)

### Storyboards and Wireframes

The initial story board I sketched and showed to my user group is below. 

![IMG-1374](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54897462/66157154-26a90180-e5f1-11e9-8629-f16f53c2f854.JPG)


### Mood Board

[TSWD Mood Board.pdf](https://github.com/shannonlouisekirk/Kirk-Portfolio/files/3685728/TSWD.Mood.Board.pdf)

I did like this mood board, and I thought it would have been ideal to incorporate the styling into my final Shorthand page. Unfortunately, Shorthand does not allow for much flexibility in font choice, nor does it allow users to input custom hex codes, so I ended up using the mood board only for the colors I used in a few of the data visualizations.

### User Feedback
#### Target Audience
When I was at this stage of the process, I had identified my target audience for this project is people interested in the film industry, or people generally familiar with award-winning films, directors, and smaller-budget movies.

#### Approach to Identify Individuals to Interview
In order to select from a group of people who already have the vocabulary and familiarity with the film industry, I sent a message to all members of the MEIM program at Heinz, requesting volunteers for user feedback sessions. I interviewed the first three people who replied.  This was my best approximation at creating a random sample of people who self-identify as both interested in the industry and familiar with award winners.  

#### Interview Script
After a brief walk-through of the storyboards and sketches, I asked interviewees the following questions:

1. Please point to anything that interests you or that you would like to know more about.
2. Please point to anything that confuses you. This can be a word, phrase, section, or piece of a visualization.
3. Can you tell me in your own words what you think this project argues or accomplishes?
4. Who do you think the intended audience is?
5. What other questions do you have about this site, if any?

#### Findings from Interviews

From these interview questions, I received the following user feedback:

*Interests and What You Would Like to Know More About:*

"The studios responding to GBO stuff is interesting...I think it's very interesting to consider. Maybe break down the global market and talk about how the china BO is skewing towards them"

"I think it would be a good way to show other nominees - not just best picture - to see more of the picture of the story to see if there is any additional information?"

"Yeah, this whole how influential has it been to those people pursuing passion projects. I would like to hear more about that."

*Confusing Pieces*

"I did not realize that the Oscars sketch was just for Best Picture, so maybe make that more clear?"

"I do not know what GBO stands for. Gross box office?"

"I was confused when you went into the case studies and then started talking about something else. Maybe better or more clear transitions for each of the case studies and then back out of the case studies?"


*In Your Own Words, What Does This Accomplish?*

"I think it accomplishes the merits of what success means. I find this interesting, because it's definitely something that people consider when they are interested in a career - how do we measure success?"

"Success in the box office does not change how the awards shows choose their nominees."

*Intended Audience*

"Cinephiles. Aspiring entertainment industry professionals. Or hobbyists."

"I think it's a person that does have some knowledge of film. Like me maybe? Because I think most people don't know what box office is or care about directors."

*Other Questions or Comments*

"So would Avatar be in the Titanic category? I don't understand why you brought that in here or how those are related. Also, is this only for Best Picture? Or is this for all Oscar nominations? Because I think Avatar won something."

About the female directors at the Oscars sketch: "I'm guessing the pink points are where they won or somehting? I don't understand what these are. Are there five female directors at the oscars a year? Are there more? I don't understand what the dots mean. Is it the number of female directors, and is it how successful they were? What does this have to do with being successful and having a passion project?"

### Opportunities for Improvement

From the user feedback, I found that I had communicated the intended audience clearly. Even having identified the audience clearly, though, two of the three users I interviewed did not know all of the acronyms I used, nor did they know all of the directors I used as examples in my case studies.  This indicated to me that people who are interested in the film industry need to have more context provided to them than I originally assumed. Accounting for user feedback allowed me to have an unintended consequence: by including more context and explanation, I was able to open up the audience to more people who are not particularly interested in the film industry, but generally like going to the movies. I was therefore able to improve clarity and make the project more accessible to more people. 

In my initial assessment of user feedback, I wrote:

"All the respondents indicated that they would like to see not just best picture, director, and acting category nominations, but they would like to see all Oscar nominations. While it is useful to examine some other nominations, I do not plan to go into them in as in-depth a manner as I did for those three categories. To satisfy user-expressed curiosity, I will collect the data to include aggregated nominations for every film."

When it came down to how much time it would take to collect this data, I decided it would not add to the project enough to warrant the change. To further support my decision to not collect this additional data, when I tested the same storyboard with fellow Telling Stories with Data classmates (representing a wider audience) they did not indicate that they wanted more information about this. On the contrary, they instructed me that there was too much information and the scope was much too wide. This feedback was extremely useful, and completely true! I had over-extended the scope of my project to the point that there was nothing clear or actionable. My in-class group showed the most interest in the Kathryn Bigelow case study from my storyboard, so I decided to run with that as a frame for the second half of the project, removing the additional actor case studies, reflections on the global box office, and predictions about which studios are best positioned to move into the next decade. (From writing that sentence, I am even more sure I made the correct decision by eliminating all of these. It was just too much for a single project.)

One user expressed that she was confused at the transitions between the sections of case studies and themes. By removing many of the specific case studies and branches of the story, I was much more easily able to make logical transitions in the storytelling.

This left me with the final storyboard you see here. Please excuse the fact that this was clearly my working document, as you can see I have crossed out items as I went along.
