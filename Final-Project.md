## Part I: The Project Outline

My original project outline had a different topic and scope, but it informed the direction I ultimately decided to go with my project. To view my original project outline, see [here.](/Final-Project-Outline.md)

### What Am I Trying to Do?

The film industry measures success in two distinct ways: through prestigious award-winning and through the amount of money made at the box office. By pulling publicly available box office data and merging it with data about Oscar winners, I hoped to examine whether these two ways of measuring success were ever found together, or if they were distinct.

While this in itself interests me, I wanted to include something about a social or representational aspect of the industry as well, especially as that was the full focus of my original proposal. I ultimately landed with the female director perspective for a few reasons:

1. The idea of attaining success in more than one avenue - "having it all" - very clearly harkens to feminist cultural language, so weaving the thematic thread for this persepctive felt natural.
2. There are so few female directors that it allowed me to create a comprehensive data set, as gender-associated data was not easily available. It would have been an extraordinary amount of effort to do the same for producers (there are often around five producers for large films) or for cast or line share.
3. I myself am a female director, so this perspective gave me the ability to form a call to action that was meaningful to me.
