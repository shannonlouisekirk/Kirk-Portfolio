## Part I: The Project Proposal and Outline

My original project outline had a different topic and scope, but it informed the direction I ultimately decided to go with my project. To view my original project outline, see [here.](/Final-Project-Outline.md)

### What Am I Trying to Do?

The film industry measures success in two distinct ways: through prestigious award-winning and through the amount of money made at the box office. By pulling publicly available box office data and merging it with data about Oscar winners, I hoped to examine whether these two ways of measuring success were ever found together, or if they were distinct.

While this in itself interests me, I wanted to include something about a social or representational aspect of the industry as well, especially as that was the full focus of my original proposal. I ultimately landed with the female director perspective for a few reasons:

1. The idea of attaining success in more than one avenue - "having it all" - very clearly harkens to feminist cultural language, so weaving the thematic thread for this persepctive felt natural.
2. There are so few female directors that it allowed me to create a comprehensive data set, as gender-associated data was not easily available. It would have been an extraordinary amount of effort to do the same for producers (there are often around five producers for large films) or for cast or line share.
3. I myself am a female director, so this perspective gave me the ability to form a call to action that was meaningful to me.

### Initial Sketches (Relevant to Where the Project Ended Up)

For a more sketches of where I was originally headed, again, feel free to view [my original project outline.](/Final-Project-Outline.md)

Sketches I drew initially that are relevant to my final project outcome are below.

### The Data

The data files that I compiled and used for the final project can be found here 
for box office data: https://shannonlouisekirk.github.io/Kirk-Portfolio/Box Office Data.xlsx
for Oscars data: https://shannonlouisekirk.github.io/Kirk-Portfolio/Oscars Data.xlsx

If you are unable to access the data through GitHub, you can view them here: https://cmu.box.com/s/8tnr89kwm1h9s4aby63727kxe7y4q794

I compiled all of the box office data using https://www.boxofficemojo.com/, and I compiled all Oscars data using https://www.imdb.com/. Both of these data source did require that I do a good amount of manual work to join the data, ensure that the movies were being reported the same way (for example, Beauty & the Beast vs Beauty and the Beast). The Oscars data in particular was very manual. To match directors with their films, I essentially just had to search IMDb and manually type in the values. Similarly, to create the binary identifications for male/female director and to create the binary distinctions for nominated for Best Picture/Best Director, I had to manually evaluate each observation and assign the appropriate value.

### Method and Medium

#### Method

My method generally followed asking the following questions:

1. *Can I point to examples of box office success vs critical success in a clear way so the audience understands the general idea?"*
2. *Are there any outstanding points in the data that are worth noting?*
3. *Is there a compelling story behind any of these individual observations?*
4. *Female representation behind the camera in Hollywood is widely recognized to be poor. Are there new ways to think about this that sheds light on the state of representation and where there is most obviously room for improvement?*
5. *Is either box office success or critical success more favorable to female directors, or are they equally poorly represented in each?*

#### Medium

As noted in the above link to the final project, I used Shorthand as the medium.

## Part II: Wireframes, Storyboards, Moodboards, and User Research

By the time I had arrived at Part II, I had shifted to closer to what the final project ended up representing. For the original submission of Part II, see [here](/Final-Project-Part-II.md)
