# Hollywood Diversity Report
## An examination of the effects of diversity in casting, directing, writing, and producing in the US film industry's profits and awards

### What Am I Trying to Do?
Hollywood institutions have been saying for years that they value racial and gender minorities. Saying it is one thing. Doing it is another.
Of course, there are some notable success stories. After two years in a row of #OscarsSoWhite, 2019 saw Best Picture nominees for Roma and BlacKkKlansman, with a long-awaited Best Adapted Screenplay win for Spike Lee. Meanwhile, films like Black Panther and Crazy Rich Asians dominated the 2018 box office. The hope is that these films indicate a changing tide and that Hollywood will continue to produce and reward more diverse work. But is that happening?
I plan to investigate the following through data visualizations:
1. For all aspects of the industry, is there actually more diversity, or just the appearance of diversity? If diversity has been increasing, at what rate?
2. How are diversely cast and produced films performing at the box office, especially the Global Box Office (GBO)?
3. Are studios investing in minority filmmakers proportionately to their non-minority counterparts?
4. Do award-granting institutions (the Academy, the HFP, SAG) all recognize minorities at similar rates and with similar proportions?
5. When it comes to increasing diversity, what side of the film industry has been more successful: the critical darlings or the blockbuster-smashes?

### Call to Action
Increasing diversity is good for its own sake. People should be able to tell their own stories. Audience should be able to see themselves on the screen. Unfortunately, it is rare that this is enough to convince an executive to give millions of dollars to finance a film, especially for films with minority directors and producers.
Evidence, partly from UCLA's annual Hollywood Diversity Report, has shown that films with diverse casts have been performing increasingly well year over year at the GBO, especially relative to non-diverse casts. This should be more of an incentive for executives to finance ambitious and more expensive minority-driven projects.
I assume that not a lot of executives will be reading this report, but they will see the box office reports of people who go to films. My hope is that this project will incentivize movie-goers to send a message to executives with financing capabilities that diverse representations are profitable.

### My Backup Plan
I have not been able to get my hands on the source data for UCLA's Hollywod Diversity Report. While I think there are ways I can tell the same story without that specific data set, it would be nearly impossible to have the level of robustness needed on the scale provided by that report.
So, as a backup plan, I plan to either analyze box office earnings (easily exportable at varying levels of granularity from Box Office Mojo) or Billboard Hot 100 (also easily exportable from Billboard's site) as they compare to award winners. For example, It: Chapter 2 has won the past two weeks at the box office, but it is extremely doubtful that it will be nominated for any awards. Sometimes, though rarely, prestige pictures become box office hits. I'd like to examine this data and see if there are any trends.
As I just mentioned, acquiring the data for box office numbers going back several years is not difficult. Similarly, acquiring the data for Oscar or Grammy nominees is fairly easy. In fact, [the New York Times published an article](/https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/03/03/movies/oscars-best-picture-box-office.html) in 2018 that examined this exact idea, and this article should be easy to scrape data from.
