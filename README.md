# Kirk-Portfolio
In this repository, you will find my public portfolio for the Telling Stories with Data course at Carnegie Mellon. I welcome your feedback on any and all visualizations published here!

# About Me
My name is Shannon Kirk (she/her), and I am a first-year student in the MEIM (Masters of Entertainment Industry Management) program at Heinz College. Prior to coming to CMU, I worked as a Project Manager at the Walt Disney Company in Digital Media Forecasting & Analytics.  My team was tasked with compiling data from myriad sources in order to get a holistic understanding of viewer behavior for all Disney-owned digital platforms. Oftentimes, we would struggle to synethesize the most important data, trends, and outliers in a way that was clear and meaningful to our stakeholders across the organization. Because of that, I grew to appreciate visualizations that told a clear story about our users and their viewing habits in a way that could drive strategy and identify opportunities for growth.  After completing my degree at CMU, I want to work in strategy, distribution, or acquisitions for a film studio or media company. 

# What I Hope to Learn in This Course
I hope to build a toolkit for visualizing data in a compelling way. There is often so much data available, especially in the digital media and entertainment space, that the true message of the data can easily be obscured. By cutting through the noise and designing purposeful visualizations, I hope to aid more informed decision-making.
