### User Feedback
#### Target Audience
The target audience for this project is people interested in the film industry, or people generally familiar with award-winning films,  directors, and smaller-budget movies.

#### Approach to Identify Individuals to Interview
In order to select from a group of people who already have the vocabulary and familiarity with the film industry, I sent a message to all members of the MEIM program at Heinz, requesting volunteers for user feedback sessions. I interviewed the first four people who replied.  This was my best approximation at creating a random sample of people who self-identify as both interested in the industry and familiar with award winners.  

#### Interview Script
After a brief walk-through of the storyboards and sketches, I asked interviewees the following questions:

1. Please point to anything that interests you or that you would like to know more about.
2. Please point to anything that confuses you. This can be a word, phrase, section, or piece of a visualization.
3. Can you tell me in your own words what you think this project argues or accomplishes?
4. Who do you think the intended audience is?
5. What other questions do you have about this site, if any?
