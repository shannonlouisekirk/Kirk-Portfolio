# Indie flick or blockbuster hit?
## A comparison of critical darlings and box office smashes of the past thirty years.

### Storyboards and Wireframes

The initial story board I sketched and showed to my user group is below.

### User Feedback
#### Target Audience
The target audience for this project is people interested in the film industry, or people generally familiar with award-winning films,  directors, and smaller-budget movies.

#### Approach to Identify Individuals to Interview
In order to select from a group of people who already have the vocabulary and familiarity with the film industry, I sent a message to all members of the MEIM program at Heinz, requesting volunteers for user feedback sessions. I interviewed the first three people who replied.  This was my best approximation at creating a random sample of people who self-identify as both interested in the industry and familiar with award winners.  

#### Interview Script
After a brief walk-through of the storyboards and sketches, I asked interviewees the following questions:

1. Please point to anything that interests you or that you would like to know more about.
2. Please point to anything that confuses you. This can be a word, phrase, section, or piece of a visualization.
3. Can you tell me in your own words what you think this project argues or accomplishes?
4. Who do you think the intended audience is?
5. What other questions do you have about this site, if any?

#### Findings from Interviews

From these interview questions, I received the following user feedback:

*Interests and What You Would Like to Know More About:*

"The studios responding to GBO stuff is interesting...I think it's very interesting to consider. Maybe break down the global market and talk about how the china BO is skewing towards them"

"I think it would be a good way to show other nominees - not just best picture - to see more of the picture of the story to see if there is any additional information?"

"Yeah, this whole how influential has it been to those people pursuing passion projects. I would like to hear more about that."

*Confusing Pieces*

"I did not realize that the Oscars sketch was just for Best Picture, so maybe make that more clear?"

"I do not know what GBO stands for. Gross box office?"

"I was confused when you went into the case studies and then started talking about something else. Maybe better or more clear transitions for each of the case studies and then back out of the case studies?"


*In Your Own Words, What Does This Accomplish?*

"I think it accomplishes the merits of what success means. I find this interesting, because it's definitely something that people consider when they are interested in a career - how do we measure success?"

"Success in the box office does not change how the awards shows choose their nominees."

*Intended Audience*

"Cinephiles. Aspiring entertainment industry professionals. Or hobbyists."

"I think it's a person that does have some knowledge of film. Like me maybe? Because I think most people don't know what box office is or care about directors."

*Other Questions or Comments*

"So would Avatar be in the Titanic category? I don't understand why you brought that in here or how those are related. Also, is this only for Best Picture? Or is this for all Oscar nominations? Because I think Avatar won something."

About the female directors at the Oscars sketch: "I'm guessing the pink points are where they won or somehting? I don't understand what these are. Are there five female directors at the oscars a year? Are there more? I don't understand what the dots mean. Is it the number of female directors, and is it how successful they were? What does this have to do with being successful and having a passion project?"

### Data Visualizations and Sketches

### Opportunities for Improvement

From the user feedback, I found that I had communicated the intended audience clearly. Even having identified the audience clearly, though, two of the three users I interviewed did not know all of the acronyms I used, nor did they know all of the directors I used as examples in my case studies. I will be sure to include more definitions and context in my final project. This will improve clarity, but it will also serve to make this project more accessible to people who are interested in the film or entertainment industry, but do not have the background to understand the project in full.

All the respondents indicated that they would like to see not just best picture, director, and acting category nominations, but they would like to see all Oscar nominations. While it is useful to examine some other nominations, I do not plan to go into them in as in-depth a manner as I did for those three categories. To satisfy user-expressed curiosity, I will collect the data to include aggregated nominations for every film.

One user expressed that she was confused at the transitions between the sections of case studies and themes. I still need to think about the best way to make these transitions flow more smoothly and logically in the final presentation.

I also found that some of the data visualizations I chose (like the unit chart representing female directors) was not commonly understood or intuitive, and it took users some time to understand what that chart represented. One user, in fact, never came to the understanding what that chart meant. I need to rework several of the charts and then get more user feedback to ensure they are more intuitive and do not require extra explanations.
